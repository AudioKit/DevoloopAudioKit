# Guitar Processors for AudioKit

While all of AudioKit's effects and filters can be useful for processing guitar,
this package contains AudioKit nodes that are distinctly guitaristic in their intent.

  * DynaRage Compressor - tube compressor emulation
  * Rhino Guitar Processor - guitar amplifier head and cabinet simulator

Both of these were written by Mike Gazzarusso.
